I am a research assistant in the [Biorobotics Lab](https://biorobotics.org/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/) (the U.S.). I received my Master of Science in Robotics (MSR) degree from the same lab, advised by [Prof. Howie Choset](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~choset/) and in collaboration with my thesis comittee member [Prof. Guanya Shi](https://www.gshi.me/). Before joining CMU, I received my B.Eng. degree in Vehicle Enigineering from [Tongji University](https://www.tongji.edu.cn/) (China). My current research focuses on (1) robotic motion planning and kinematics, and (2) robotic system design.
